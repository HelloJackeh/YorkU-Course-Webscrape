# YorkU-Course-Webscrape
<b> Scrapes course names off York's Current Student's Website for easier viewing without jumping through so many hoops </b>

<b> To-Dos: </b>
<ul>
  Allow people to custom search courses (use of scanner?) and check if it's offered in certain sessions (ex: Fall/Winter/Summer)
  Display courses in a simple format (or at least allow the user to view multiple course sections in new tabs/same page)
  </ul>
